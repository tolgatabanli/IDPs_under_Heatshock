# Yeast PPI Network

## The source

The source for the interactions is Biogrid.
Explanations on format tab3 and headers:
https://wiki.thebiogrid.org/doku.php/biogrid_tab_version_3.0

Read data that have genetic and physical interactions inclusive with few other organisms.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# 2. LOAD ALREADY SAVED RDS raw_data:
raw_data <- read_rds("biogrid_yeast.rds")
```

The data contain both genetic and protein interactions.
```{r}
raw_data <- raw_data %>% select(starts_with("Systematic"), `Experimental System Type`, starts_with("Organism"), Modification, Score)

# Filter only yeast-yeast interactions
yeast_interactions <- raw_data %>%
  filter(`Organism Name Interactor A` == "Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288c)" &
           `Organism Name Interactor B` == "Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S288c)") %>%
  select(-starts_with("Organism"))

nrow(yeast_interactions) / nrow(raw_data)

```

```{r, include=FALSE}
rm(raw_data)
```

```{r}
# The two types of interactions are phsyical (proteins) and genetic:
yeast_interactions %>% select(`Experimental System Type`) %>% distinct()
```

# PPI Network

We are continuing with PPI. And eliminate duplicates in the dataset. (There
may still be duplicates as combinations where order matters.)

```{r}
prot_int <- yeast_interactions %>%
  filter(`Experimental System Type` == "physical") %>% select(-`Experimental System Type`)
# Filter out duplicate entries
uni_prot_int <- prot_int %>%
  distinct(`Systematic Name Interactor A`, `Systematic Name Interactor B`, .keep_all = T)
```

## igraph

Create an igraph object from PPI data frame. Simplifying removes loops
and multiple edges. Explore change in the number of edges:

```{r}
prot_graph <- graph_from_data_frame(uni_prot_int, directed = FALSE)
E(prot_graph) %>% length()
prot_graph <- prot_graph %>% simplify()
E(prot_graph) %>% length()
```

We can also cut out unconnected components from our graph.
These are most probably isolated nodes that were
due to insufficient coverage of the data set.

```{r}
comps <- components(prot_graph) # has vectors named $membership, $csize and $no
membership <- comps$membership
unc <- membership[membership == 2]

# Cut out the unconnected single protein(s)
prot_graph <- delete_vertices(prot_graph, names(unc))
```

### Some analyticals

Finding average shortest (or characteristic) path length is
important in graph analysis.

```{r}
mean_path_prot <- mean_distance(prot_graph)
mean_path_prot
```

The clustering coefficient:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
clust_coef_prot <- ClustF(as_adjacency_matrix(prot_graph) %>% as.matrix(), type = "undirected", isolates = "NaN")
```

Now, let's compare these with those of a random graph.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
load("clustering_coeffs.RData")
```


```{r, eval=FALSE}
random_graph <- sample_gnm(gorder(prot_graph), ecount(prot_graph))
mean_path_random <- mean_distance(random_graph)
clust_coef_random <- ClustF(as_adjacency_matrix(random_graph) %>% as.matrix(), type = "undirected", isolates = "NaN")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data.frame('Characteristic Path' = c(mean_path_prot,
                                     mean_path_random),
           'Coefficient of Clustering' = c(clust_coef_prot$GlobalCC,
                                           clust_coef_random$GlobalCC),
           row.names = c("PPI Graph", "Random graph")) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()
```

## Cytoscape

Because it is practically impossible to visualize the whole network
due to HUGE computationally intensive waiting PERIOD,
let's take a subgraph induced by the protein RAD53, or YPL153C.

```{r cy, eval=FALSE}
cytoscapePing()
neighbors <- neighbors(prot_graph, "YPL153C")
ind_subgraph <- induced_subgraph(prot_graph, c("YPL153C", neighbors$name))
createNetworkFromIgraph(ind_subgraph, title = "Yeast PPI")
setVisualStyle('Marquee')
exportImage("tmp1", 'PNG', zoom=200)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Network of yeast PPI extracted from Biogrid, on Cytoscape", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tmp1.png")
```

Now let's focus on all interactions that have modification data.

```{r}
mod_graph <- uni_prot_int %>%
  filter(Modification != "-") %>%
  graph_from_data_frame()
```

Let's customize the network based on the attribute "modification".
This way, we can visualize what kind of modifications
our chosen nodes may undergo. First, look up which modifications are entered:

```{r}
mods <- mod_graph %>%
  E() %>% `$`("Modification") %>%
  unique()
```

We should also regenerate the igraph, since simplifying removes
edge attributes, but deleting node does not.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
createNetworkFromIgraph(mod_graph)


edge_data <- data.frame(
  source = as_ids(head_of(mod_graph, E(mod_graph))),
  target = as_ids(tail_of(mod_graph, E(mod_graph))),
  Modification = E(mod_graph)$Modification
)

setVisualStyle("default")  # Start with the default style or create a new one

# Load the edge attr into Cy
loadTableData(edge_data, data.key.column = "source", table = "edge", table.key.column = "source")

modification_colors <- c(
  "No Modification"      = "#A9A9A9",  # Darker gray
  "Phosphorylation"      = "#FF4500",  # Orange-red
  "Dephosphorylation"    = "#FF8C00",  # Dark orange
  "Deubiquitination"     = "#32CD32",  # Lime green
  "Glycosylation"        = "#4682B4",  # Steel blue
  "Methylation"          = "#8A2BE2",  # Blue violet
  "Acetylation"          = "#DA70D6",  # Orchid
  "Sumoylation"          = "#FFD700",  # Gold
  "Ubiquitination"       = "#FF6347",  # Tomato
  "Prenylation"          = "#20B2AA",  # Light sea green
  "Deacetylation"        = "#DB7093",  # Pale violet red
  "Nedd(Rub1)ylation"    = "#B8860B",  # Dark goldenrod
  "Demethylation"        = "#9932CC",  # Dark orchid
  "Proteolytic Processing" = "#C71585",  # Medium violet red
  "Desumoylation"        = "#6495ED",  # Cornflower blue
  "Deneddylation"        = "#008080"   # Teal
)

setEdgeColorMapping("Modification", mods, modification_colors, mapping.type = "d")
exportImage("tmp2.png", 'PNG', zoom=200)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Network of PPI with edges colored according to modification type", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("tmp2.png")
```

Let's now visualize the edge sizes based on the scores.

```{r}
mod_graph <- uni_prot_int %>%
  filter(Score != "-") %>%
    graph_from_data_frame()

createNetworkFromIgraph(mod_graph)

node_attr <- data.frame(degrees = degree(mod_graph),
          row.names = V(mod_graph)$name)
loadTableData(node_attr)
setNodeSizeMapping("degrees", c(1,3,5,7), c(20,40,60,80))
```
