  abstract           = {The structural stability of a protein requires a large number of interresidue interactions. The energetic contribution of these can be approximated by low-resolution force fields extracted from known structures, based on observed amino acid pairing frequencies. The summation of such energies, however, cannot be carried out for proteins whose structure is not known or for intrinsically unstructured proteins. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel method for estimating the total pairwise interaction energy, based on a quadratic form in the amino acid composition of the protein. This approach is validated by the good correlation of the estimated and actual energies of proteins of known structure and by a clear separation of folded and disordered proteins in the energy space it defines. As the novel algorithm has not been trained on unstructured proteins, it substantiates the concept of protein disorder, i.e. that the inability to form a well-defined 3D structure is an intrinsic property of many proteins and protein domains. This property is encoded in their sequence, because their biased amino acid composition does not allow sufficient stabilizing interactions to form. By limiting the calculation to a predefined sequential neighborhood, the algorithm was turned into a position-specific scoring scheme that characterizes the tendency of a given amino acid to fall into an ordered or disordered region. This application we term IUPred and compare its performance with three generally accepted predictors, PONDR VL3H, DISOPRED2 and GlobPlot on a database of disordered proteins.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are ubiquitous across all domains of life and play a range of functional roles. While folded domains are generally well described by a stable three-dimensional structure, IDRs exist in a collection of interconverting states known as an ensemble. This structural heterogeneity means that IDRs are largely absent from the Protein Data Bank, contributing to a lack of computational approaches to predict ensemble conformational properties from sequence. Here we combine rational sequence design, large-scale molecular simulations and deep learning to develop ALBATROSS, a deep-learning model for predicting ensemble dimensions of IDRs, including the radius of gyration, end-to-end distance, polymer-scaling exponent and ensemble asphericity, directly from sequences at a proteome-wide scale. ALBATROSS is lightweight, easy to use and accessible as both a locally installable software package and a point-and-click-style interface via Google Colab notebooks. We first demonstrate the applicability of our predictors by examining the generalizability of sequence-ensemble relationships in IDRs. Then, we leverage the high-throughput nature of ALBATROSS to characterize the sequence-specific biophysical behavior of IDRs within and between proteomes.},

These regions are structurally heterogeneous, ubiquitous and found across all kingdoms of life. Despite the absence of a defined 3D structure, disordered regions are essential for cellular processes ranging from transcriptional control and cell signalling to subcellular organization. Through their conformational malleability and adaptability, disordered regions extend the repertoire of macromolecular interactions and are readily tunable by their structural and chemical context, making them ideal responders to regulatory cues. Recent work has led to major advances in understanding the link between protein sequence and conformational behaviour in disordered regions, yet the link between sequence and molecular function is less well defined. Here we consider the biochemical and biophysical foundations that underlie how and why disordered regions can engage in productive cellular functions, provide examples of emerging concepts and discuss how protein disorder contributes to intracellular information processing and regulation of cellular function.},

This work laid the foundation for the sequence-structure-function paradigm, which states that the sequence of a protein determines its structure, and structure determines function. However, a class of polypeptide segments called intrinsically disordered regions does not conform to this postulate. In this review, I will first describe established and emerging ideas about how disordered regions contribute to protein function. I will then discuss molecular principles by which regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and asymmetric localization of transcripts that encode disordered regions, can increase the functional versatility of proteins. Finally, I will discuss how disordered regions contribute to human disease and the emergence of cellular complexity during organismal evolution.},

Some of these mechanisms have been well characterized in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an excellent experimental model to explore and elucidate some of the strategies selected in eukaryotic organisms to adjust their growth and development in stressful conditions. The relevance of structural disorder in proteins and the impact on their functions has been uncovered for proteins participating in different processes. This is the case of some transcription factors (TFs) and other signaling hub proteins, where intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play a critical role in their function. In this work, we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis to evaluate the significance of structural disorder in those TFs (170) recognized in S. cerevisiae. Our findings show that 85.2% of these TFs contain at least one IDR, whereas ~30% exhibit a higher disorder level and thus were considered as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We also found that TFs contain a higher number of IDRs compared to the rest of the yeast proteins, and that intrinsically disordered TFs (IDTFs) have a higher number of protein-protein interactions than those with low structural disorder. The analysis of different stress response pathways showed a high content of structural disorder not only in TFs but also in other signaling proteins. The propensity of yeast proteome to undergo a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) was also analyzed, showing that a significant proportion of IDTFs may undergo this phenomenon. Our analysis is a starting point for future research on the importance of structural disorder in yeast stress responses.},

  abstract               = {Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are proteins that lack rigid 3D structure. Hence, they are often misconceived to present a challenge to Anfinsen's dogma. However, IDPs exist as ensembles that sample a quasi-continuum of rapidly interconverting conformations and, as such, may represent proteins at the extreme limit of the Anfinsen postulate. IDPs play important biological roles and are key components of the cellular protein interaction network (PIN). Many IDPs can interconvert between disordered and ordered states as they bind to appropriate partners. Conformational dynamics of IDPs contribute to conformational noise in the cell. Thus, the dysregulation of IDPs contributes to increased noise and "promiscuous" interactions. This leads to PIN rewiring to output an appropriate response underscoring the critical role of IDPs in cellular decision making. Nonetheless, IDPs are not easily tractable experimentally. Furthermore, in the absence of a reference conformation, discerning the energy landscape representation of the weakly funneled IDPs in terms of reaction coordinates is challenging. To understand conformational dynamics in real time and decipher how IDPs recognize multiple binding partners with high specificity, several sophisticated knowledge-based and physics-based in silico sampling techniques have been developed. Here, using specific examples, we highlight recent advances in energy landscape visualization and molecular dynamics simulations to discern conformational dynamics and discuss how the conformational preferences of IDPs modulate their function, especially in phenotypic switching. Finally, we discuss recent progress in identifying small molecules targeting IDPs underscoring the potential therapeutic value of IDPs. Understanding structure and function of IDPs can not only provide new insight on cellular decision making but may also help to refine and extend Anfinsen's structure/function paradigm.},

The generality of this phenomenon, however, is questioned by the uncertainty of what fraction of genomes actually encodes for expressed proteins. Here, we used two independent bioinformatic predictors, PONDR VSL1, and IUPred, to demonstrate that disorder prevails in the recently characterized proteomes and essential proteins of E. coli and S. cerevisiae, at levels exceeding that estimated from the genomes. The S. cerevisiae proteome contains three times as much disorder as that of E. coli, with 50-60% of proteins containing at least one long (>30 residues) disordered segment. This evolutionary advance can be explained by the observation that disorder is much higher in Gene Ontology categories related to regulatory, as opposed to metabolic, functions, and also in categories unique to yeast. Thus, protein disorder is a widespread and functionally important phenomenon, which needs to be characterized in full detail for understanding complex organisms at the molecular level.},

  abstract = {We present the Database of Disordered Protein Prediction (D2P2), available at http://d2p2.pro (including website source code). A battery of disorder predictors and their variants, VL-XT, VSL2b, PrDOS, PV2, Espritz and IUPred, were run on all protein sequences from 1765 complete proteomes (to be updated as more genomes are completed). Integrated with these results are all of the predicted (mostly structured) SCOP domains using the SUPERFAMILY predictor. These disorder/structure annotations together enable comparison of the disorder predictors with each other and examination of the overlap between disordered predictions and SCOP domains on a large scale. D2P2 will increase our understanding of the interplay between disorder and structure, the genomic distribution of disorder, and its evolutionary history. The parsed data are made available in a unified format for download as flat files or SQL tables either by genome, by predictor, or for the complete set. An interactive website provides a graphical view of each protein annotated with the SCOP domains and disordered regions from all predictors overlaid (or shown as a consensus). There are statistics and tools for browsing and comparing genomes and their disorder within the context of their position on the tree of life.},

  abstract = {Although structural domains in proteins (SDs) are important, half of the regions in the human proteome are currently left with no SD assignments. These unassigned regions consist not only of novel SDs, but also of intrinsically disordered (ID) regions since proteins, especially those in eukaryotes, generally contain a significant fraction of ID regions. As ID regions can be inferred from amino acid sequences, a method that combines SD and ID region assignments can determine the fractions of SDs and ID regions in any proteome.},

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1-4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence--the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8--has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10-14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

  abstract = {Intrinsically disordered proteins and protein regions (IDPs/IDRs) carry out important biological functions without relying on a single well-defined conformation. As these proteins are a challenge to study experimentally, computational methods play important roles in their characterization. One of the commonly used tools is the IUPred web server which provides prediction of disordered regions and their binding sites. IUPred is rooted in a simple biophysical model and uses a limited number of parameters largely derived on globular protein structures only. This enabled an incredibly fast and robust prediction method, however, its limitations have also become apparent in light of recent breakthrough methods using deep learning techniques. Here, we present AIUPred, a novel version of IUPred which incorporates deep learning techniques into the energy estimation framework. It achieves improved performance while keeping the robustness of the original method. Based on the evaluation of recent benchmark datasets, AIUPred scored amongst the top three single sequence based methods. With a new web server we offer fast and reliable visual analysis for users as well as options to analyze whole genomes in mere seconds with the downloadable package. AIUPred is available at https://aiupred.elte.hu.},
