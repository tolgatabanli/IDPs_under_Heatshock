This chapter deals with how the results of DESeq analysis was visualized
and used to graphically compare the differences between IDP expression
and the overall expression patterns. I have used bar plots to distinguish
the number of up and down-regulated genes, heatmaps for comparison of
expression patterns and clusters in different genotypes and lastly
gene enrichment analysis to find out the functions of the IDPs
implicated in heat shock and possible broken down in knock-down and
knock-out.

## Up or Down?

## Heatmaps

## Gene Enrichment Analysis
